            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Summary</h3>
            <p class="info">I really enjoy helping people. Troubleshooting and solving peoples technology problems is something I
                take delight in. I'm skilled at programming, math, reading, and telling (clean) jokes. I really want to work in the
                Tech industry. I would consider being an On-site Technician, Web Developer, Webmaster, and/or perhaps
                managing others within the Tech field.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I've worked as a Program Mentor for Code
                            To Success 2021 Summer Program with the
                            Success in Education Foundation. I was
                            able to provide support including technical
                            instruction and assistance, motivation, and
                            inspiration to my students. I directed
                            meetings with my students, and provided
                            added assistance with other mentors. I also
                            managed student data and organized it for
                            my supervisors.</li>
                        <li>I volunteered at Camp Eagle Mountain
                            Scout Camp in the summer of 2019. While
                            volunteering I was able to teach young cub
                            scouts some first aid, plant identification,
                            and helped build and supervise an obstacle
                            course.</li>
                        <li>Currently I'm a janitor in Alpine School
                            District. I've been able to increase my ability
                            to work hard, and to complete tasks that
                            others aren't usually willing to do. I'm also
                            developing my skill in communicating with
                            co-workers and supervisors.</li>
